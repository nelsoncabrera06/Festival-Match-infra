# Include plugin cache directory
# .terraform.lock.hcl 
# This file is like package-lock.json in Node 
# or requirements.txt in Python; 
# It ensures that if a colleague of yours (or a CI/CD system) downloads the project, 
# it installs exactly the same version 3.6.2 of kreuzwerker that you have now, avoiding surprises.
# this is why it is included in version control.
